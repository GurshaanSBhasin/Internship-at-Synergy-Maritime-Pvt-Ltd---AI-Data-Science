# Internship-at-Synergy-Maritime-Pvt-Ltd---AI-Data-Science
Here is a report and ppt describing the work I was engaged in during my internship in the months of September and October ,23' in Synergy Maritime in Chennai as a part of the tech team , where I worked on not only the data scientists team, but also the software team. Here I worked on Graphical User database systems specifically the Neo4j system with Cypher language inhouse queries , while also incorporating the CSV datas and graphs made into python code by calling its API with the Jupiter notebooks coding platform.
Furthermore , to understand the system of API better , I made by own chatbot using both GPT as well as Llama by importing their API's and also playing around with them such as only displaying answers to the users queries with emojis.
My work during the internship with the team was primarily to help with the development of the companys own in house chatbot - Syia , which worked to not only give answers , but also recommendations to other related queries' solutions. This was done by connecting recommendations firstly in the Graphical DB along with answers , then allocating a count for recommendations based on memmory of previous users for the best suggestions , it also used key value pair generations for these answers thus all in all making a solid system for fetching answers and recommendations to a users queries through API in python code.
